Hi! Welcome to Module 3 titled as social inclusion in sport projects: Leaving no one behind!

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.500
In the age of migration, the number and importance of social inclusion projects have increased.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:28.500
In the societies involving people from different backgrounds in terms of ethnicity, religion, gender and ability, to provide equal access to opportunities for every citizen is one of the primary responsibilities of states and civil society.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:42.500
Projects conducted by civil society support to create an equalitarian atmosphere by both providing inclusive environment in their own body and organizing events to contribute social inclusion in the society. 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:54.100
Some subjects are more favourable than others to support social inclusion in the field of civil society, i.e. sports and art form an extremely favourable ground for social inclusion.
